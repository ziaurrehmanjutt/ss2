## Security By Default
By default this extension will do nothing! This is entirely by design. In order for you to add CORS headers, we HIGHLY recommend [understanding the security risks involved with CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

We want to you configure the module to do precisely what you want. To make this process easier, you can [follow along with our configuration guide](/docs/stories/configuring-the-headers.md).
